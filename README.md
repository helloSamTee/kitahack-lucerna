# Lucerna

## Overview
This is a Flutter porject in Andriod Studio for implementing Lucerna - a smart eco mobile app that helps users to track, offset, and understand their carbon footprint in collaboration with the innovative Ecolight.

Ecolight is an algae-breeding street lamp that captures carbon, helping users reduce their carbon emissions and offset their daily activities. With the growth rate exceeding all terrestrial plants, 1 tons of algae can capture nearly 2 tons of carbon dioxide, just by harvesting the light energy from Ecolight that provides essential lighting that cities need. 

For Ecolight to be part of the city landscape, Lucerna app is developed to monitor user's carbon emissions, see real-time data on their carbon offset, and encourage eco-conscious learning with AI-powered features.

## Features
Here is what you can achieve through Lucerna source code:


### Carbon Tracking
Daily, Weekly, and Monthly View: Visualize carbon emissions and offsets over time, with easy-to-access tabs for daily, weekly, and monthly statistics.

### Carbon Offset with Ecolight
Real-time Offset Updates: Track the total carbon offset achieved today with Ecolight in real time.

### Carbon Footprint Calculation
Activity-based Footprint Calculation: Log daily activities (Food, travel journey, or energy consumption) and leverage Gemini AI’s powerful algorithms to estimate the carbon footprint.

### Eco-Education with AI
AI-Powered Conversations: Engage with an AI assistant to learn more about environmental issues, up-to-date carbon footprint reduction strategies, and thus make eco-conscious choices in daily life.



## Instructions

3. Track Emissions and Offset:
   Use the Lucerna dashboard to monitor carbon emissions and the offset generated by Ecolight, in a daily, weekly, or monthly timeframe.
   
4. Ecolight Offset Monitoring
   View real-time environmental data gathered by Ecolight to track CO₂ emissions and physical conditions.
   
5. Calculate Carbon Footprint:
   Record daily activities (Food, travel journey, or energy consumption) and use the Gemini AI-powered calculator for personalized carbon footprint insights.
   
6. Learn with AI:
   Start a conversation with Lucerna’s AI to stay informed on eco-friendly living and environmental issues.



## Development Environmetn Setup  


1. Java version: JDK 17
2. Gradle version: 8.10.2



## Features under Development
Due to the time contraint, these features are still under development, and the codes provided are actually the non-functional prototypes (dummy codes):


##### 1. Record Tracking
All the carbon footprint records are stored per session only, in other words, the records are lost once the user exits Lucerna app.

##### 2. Dashboard
Without database, Lucerna is unable to generate charts and statistics that summarise the carbon footprint and offset of the user. The charts displayed currently are just for illustration purpose.

##### 3. IoT Device Connection
Lucerna collects real-time statistic only from a particular Ecolight product. Users are unable to connect their own Ecolight products to respective user accounts yet.
  > Random values (Light Intensity, Carbon Dioxide, Temparature and Algae Bloom Status) are displayed for user who does not own and connect Ecolight product.
